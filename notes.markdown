# Foreword
This is a guide for everyone wanting to learn how to spreedrun Shadowrun on SNES (or emulators) in the "Any%" category. 
I first stumbled about Shadowrun on the [reddit (r/speedrun) post](https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/iwx2ce/shadowrun_snes_any_in_11544/) of Elastoid claiming to found a new route to break the two years old record. After that I tried the game and saw that it is fun and a game that I possibly want to speedrun. However, the [guides section](https://www.speedrun.com/shadowrun_snes/guides) on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com) had no explainition of any route.

So this is the first attempt to create the first guide for a Shadowrun route to get other people into running Shadowrun "Any%". For the better or worse. We will see...

Any contributions are welcome! Tell me what is wrong and what can be done 
better by submitting changes via [github page](https://github.com/glitchedDoku/shadowrun_snes_notes) or the 
[forum](https://www.speedrun.com/shadowrun_snes/thread/rpdxf).

**Disclaimer**: This is a work in progress document.
 While writing this route guide [Elastoid](https://www.twitch.tv/elastoid) broke the [world record again](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/757197125). The route for both records should be the same (Is this really true?).

******
 
## To-Do
 
 * Special tricks and movement
  * In this document are a lot of hyperlinks which do not refer to any url. The idea is to have a extra page for special tricks or movements needed during the run. Best would be to have some videos. This idea is inspired by the [SM64 Guides by GothicLogic](https://www.speedrun.com/sm64/guide/cxkjo).
 * Hacking computer
 	* reformat or restructure
   * add maps or in-game pictures
 * Generate website or/and Github page
   * This should allow others to directly contribute to this document. This should be a community effort.
 * Correct names of items and character
 * Rethink the structure of directing people
 	* For example, is it always understandable what northeast means?
 * Work on headlines and structure of the document
 	* Add/Remove split times (?)
 	* Bulleted lists; any good (?)
 	* Grammar and spelling (sorry, English isn't my first language)

# General Stuff

## Resouces
### Casual
* [Guide and Walkthrough by Admiral](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588651-shadowrun/faqs/19826)
	* Very detailed guide

### For Speedrunning
* [World Record Route Guide with Elastoid and Edgeworth](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/754351994)
	* Explanation of all tricks and route changes compared to the previous world records
* [[Youtube] Item Duplication Glitch Tutorial by StuntCoyote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKTXeDWGblE&feature=emb_title)
	* One of the most important tricks
* [Speedrun.com Leaderboards](https://www.speedrun.com/shadowrun_snes/)
* [Speedrun.com Guides](https://www.speedrun.com/shadowrun_snes/guides)


### Legend
The whole guide is organized in a big bulleted list.  
**Interaction option**, **Item name** or **Person name** are highlighted in bold.  
*Keyword* are highlighted in italic, while newly learned keywords are highlighted as this: (*Learned Keyword*).  
[Speedrunning tricks]() should contain hyperlinks to videos or other resources
explaining them. For now, none of these tricks contain hyperlinks, i.e. clicking
them will **not** redirect you somewhere. Feel free to contribute to these
resources!

### Special Meanings
For the sake of brevity I would like to shorten some "Interaction options" in the following way:

| Action | Meaning | Explanation |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| **Interact with** | Select Character and **Talk** | Better to distinguish when to "talk" to character... 
| **Talk to**           | **Interact with** + **Talk** in dialogue menu | ... or also "talk" in dialogue menu.
