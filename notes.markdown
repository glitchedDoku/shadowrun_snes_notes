  # Route [1:13:26 - Elastoid](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/751406056?collection=DfL3CcjBNhbLsQ) <br/>  Maintained by [glitchedDoku](https://www.speedrun.com/user/glitchedDoku)

  ## Foreword
    
  This is a guide for everyone wanting to learn how spreedrun Shadowrun on SNES (or emulators) in the "Any%" category. 
  I first stumbled about Shadowrun on the [reddit (r/speedrun) post](https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/iwx2ce/shadowrun_snes_any_in_11544/) of Elastoid claiming to found a new route to break the two years old record. After that I tried the game and saw that it is fun and a game that I possibly want to speedrun. However, the [guides section](https://www.speedrun.com/shadowrun_snes/guides) on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com) had no explainition of any route.
  
  So this is the first attempt to create the first guide for a Shadowrun route to get other people into running Shadowrun "Any%". For the better or worse. We will see...
  
  Any contributions are welcome! Tell me what is wrong and what can be done 
  better by submitting changes via [github page](https://github.com/glitchedDoku/shadowrun_snes_notes) or the 
  [forum](https://www.speedrun.com/shadowrun_snes/thread/rpdxf).
  
  **Disclaimer**: This is a work in progress document.
  While writing this route guide [Elastoid](https://www.twitch.tv/elastoid) broke the [world record again](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/757197125). The route for both records should be the same (Is this really true?).
  
  ******
  ## To-Do
  
  * Special tricks and movement
   * In this document are a lot of hyperlinks which do not refer to any url. The idea is to have a extra page for special tricks or movements needed during the run. Best would be to have some videos. This idea is inspired by the [SM64 Guides by GothicLogic](https://www.speedrun.com/sm64/guide/cxkjo).
  * Hacking computer
  	* reformat or restructure
    * add maps or in-game pictures
  * Generate website or/and Github page
    * This should allow others to directly contribute to this document. This should be a community effort.
  * Correct names of items and character
  * Rethink the structure of directing people
  	* For example, is it always unterstandable what northeast means?
  * Work on headlines and structure of the document
  	* Add/Remove split times (?)
  	* Bulleted lists; any good (?)
  	* Grammar and spelling (sorry, English isn't my first language)

## General Stuff

### Resouces
#### Casual
* [Guide and Walkthrough by Admiral](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588651-shadowrun/faqs/19826)
	* Very detailed guide

#### For Speedrunning
* [World Record Route Guide with Elastoid and Edgeworth](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/754351994)
	* Explenation of all tricks and route changes compared to the previous world records

#### Legend
The whole guide is oraganized in a big bulleted list.  
**Interaction option**, **Item name** or **Person name** are highlighted in bold.  
*Keyword* are highlighted in italic, while newly learned keywords are highlighted as this: (*Learned Keyword*).  
[Speedrunning tricks]() should contain hyperlinks to videos or other resources
explaining them. For now, none of these tricks contain hyperlinks, i.e. clicking
them will **not** redirect you somewhere. Feel free to contribute to these
resources!

#### Special Meanings
For the sake of brevity I would like to shorten some "Interaction options" in the following way:

| Action | Meaning | Explenation |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| **Interact with** | Select Character and **Talk** | Better to distinguish when to "talk" to character... 
| **Talk to**           | **Interact with** + **Talk** in dialogue menu | ... or also "talk" in dialogue menu.
